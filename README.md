# XINPUT-RacingWheel

This racing wheel is based in an XINPUT Xbox 360 controller.
I ported a code from TeensyLC to a STM32F103C8T6.
The original is here https://github.com/zlittell/MSF-FightStick.
Thanks Zach.

To do list:
* Read led and rumble feedback
* Improve the code
* Need to change interruption handler from encoder, sometimes the steering wheel lost the center
* Expand to others families of STM32

Some bugs may apper!

Version 1*10^0.0
